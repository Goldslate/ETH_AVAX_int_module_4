# DEGEN TOKEN

This Solidity program encapsulates the code for an ERC20 token named "DEGEN" with the symbol "DGN."
The token is specifically crafted to facilitate the redemption of in-game purchases.

## Description

This Solidity program defines the "DEGEN" Token, an ERC20 token on the Avalanche blockchain with the symbol "DGN."
Designed for in-game transactions, it facilitates seamless redemption of virtual purchases.
This code offers a foundational understanding of ERC20 token creation in Solidity, serving as a starting point for developers exploring
blockchain-based solutions.

### Getting Started
